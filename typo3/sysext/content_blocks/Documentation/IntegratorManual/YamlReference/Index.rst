Editing interface field types (YAML reference)
==============================================

The editing interface configuration only contains view related properties of
the fields (unlike in TCA). Therefore, a descriptive language (as YAML) is
sufficient and does not open up a possible security flaw.

A strict schema for field types is used to ease up the validation process for
field definitions. To keep it slim and easy to read, the mapping to TCA uses
strong defaults for field properties (e.g. default size for input is 30).

The field types for the EditorInterface.yaml are heavily inspired by the
`Symfony field types <https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types.html>`__
and is mapped to TCA. Because Symfony is quite mainstream, well-established
and documented it makes it easier to understand those types for TYPO3 newcomers/
beginners/ frontend-only devs than TYPO3's exclusive TCA, thus providing a kind
of ubiquitous language.

Field definitions
=================

Common field properties
-----------------------
.. rst-class:: dl-parameters

identifier
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Required:` true
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Type:` string
   :sep:`|`

   The field's identifier has to be unique within a Content Block. Exception is
   within a collections' field array, as this starts a new scope.

type
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Required:` true
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Type:` string
   :sep:`|`

   The field's type. See :ref:`field_types`.

properties
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Required:` false
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Type:` array
   :sep:`|`

   Array of properties that are dependent on the :ref:`field_types`.

useExistingField
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Required:` false
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Type:` bool
   :sep:`|`

   If set to true, the identifier is treated as an existing field from the Core
   or your own defined field. **Important**: Make sure `type` matches the actual
   type in TCA.

alternativeSql
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Required:` false
   :sep:`|` :aspect:`Type:` string
   :sep:`|`

   It is possible to override the default SQL definition of a field with this
   option. Example :sql:`tinyint(2) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL`. Not every field type
   can be overridden. Have a look at the default SQL in the appropriate field
   section.

	:maxdepth: 1
	:titlesonly:

	Checkbox/Index
	Collection/Index
	Color/Index
	DateTime/Index
	Email/Index
	File/Index
	Number/Index
	Radio/Index
	Select/Index
	Text/Index
	Textarea/Index
	Link/Index


Field grouping
==============

Visually grouping of fields by palettes in the editing interface is defined by
the key `palettes` Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   palettes:
      - identifier: palette_1
        label: palette_1
        fields:
        # â€¦
